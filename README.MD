# Diary of a Twitter User

retweet_bot2.py, when run, will fetch the most recent tweet from a user (currently set to the POTUS), append "Dear Diary," to it,
and then give it an Elmer Fudd-esque speech impediment.

You'll need to create a credentials.py file, containing:

```python
key = "enter-your-key-here"
secret_key = "enter-your-secret-key-here"
token = "enter-your-token-here"
secret_token = "enter-your-secret-token here"
```
those fields.
